- This distro contains the EUP5108 Assembler, Emulator, and all source roms, documentation, and example code for the user to write, run, and debug programs for the EUP5108
- Check out doc/EUP5108UserGuide.pdf for detailed information about the Operation, Instruction set, and micro-coded architecture of the EUP5108
- For a full set of explainer videos be sure to look through the [EUP5108 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLutzSUqCeqd2JNwKN7Za1qZU8AJ8HDwoR)
- Our editor of choice is [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), with it installed, Halting the Emulator will bring up the source code on the current line being executed and then grab the focus
- To add the EUP51_ASM custom language syntax file place the file "OpenEUP5108\Notepad++ files\EUP5108 Language Highlighting.xml" into your NP++ "userDefineLangs" folder located here: "\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\userDefineLangs"
- To use the custom language syntax highlighting, open an EUP5108 .asm file and select "Language|EUP51_ASM" from the main menu. NP++ should remember the selection the next time the file is loaded
