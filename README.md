# OpenEUP5108
## A Retro 8-bit, Scratch-built, Minimalist, Micro-controller
---
#This distro contains the EUP5108 Assembler, Emulator, and all source roms, documentation, and example code necessary for the user to write, run, and debug programs for the EUP5108!#
  
Check out [doc/EUP5108UserGuide.pdf](https://github.com/Emil-DV/OpenEUP5108/blob/main/doc/EUP5108UsersGuide.pdf) for detailed information about the operation, instruction set, and micro-coded architecture of the EUP5108
  
Our editor of choice is [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), with it installed, Halting the Emulator will bring up the source code on the current line being executed and then grab the focus
  
To add the EUP51_ASM custom language syntax file place the file [Notepad++ files\EUP5108 Language Highlighting.xml](https://github.com/Emil-DV/OpenEUP5108/blob/main/Notepad%2B%2B%20files/EUP5108%20Language%20Highlighting.xml) into your NP++ "userDefineLangs" folder located here: "\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\userDefineLangs"
  
To use the custom language syntax highlighting, open an EUP5108 .asm file and select "Language|EUP51_ASM" from the main menu. NP++ should remember the selection the next time the file is loaded
