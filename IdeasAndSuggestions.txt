EUP5108  ideas/suggestions

TODO
 - Document that F2 toggles the RAM view from DR|SP
 - Add syscalls via software interrupt for RTC,Sockets,Filesystem

 - Create "Why 8-bit and Why ASM" short
 
 - Creat vid about BIOS - direct printing via W1* vs BIOS call

 - malloc, free
 
 - Add memory mapped I/O for:
   "Kniting a socket Library in EUP5108 Assembly"
   Single/Dual sockets, virtual IPs 192.168.1.1 & 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 
   Socket Creation:
     socket(), AF_INET for IPv4), socket type (e.g., SOCK_STREAM for TCP, SOCK_DGRAM for UDP)
     for TCP:
      connect(), bind(), listen(), accept(), close() send(), recv(), write(), and read()
   
   
   htons() / htonl(): Convert values from host byte order to network byte order (short/long).
   ntohs() / ntohl(): Convert values from network byte order to host byte order (short/long).
   inet_addr() (IPv4 only) or inet_pton() (IPv4 and IPv6): Convert IP addresses from text string format to binary network format.

   ** Most function will be pass throughs to the emulator that calls the same functions and returns values in DRAM **

   SocketAddress structures to represent network endpoints, combining an IP address and a port number.
	struct sockaddr_in {
	    short            sin_family; // Address family (always AF_INET for IPv4)
	    unsigned short   sin_port;   // Port number (in network byte order)
	    struct in_addr   sin_addr;   // IPv4 address (struct in_addr, in network byte order)
	    char             sin_zero[8]; // Padding to make the struct the same size as sockaddr
	};

	struct in_addr {
	    unsigned long s_addr; // the IP address as a 32-bit integer (network byte order)
	};

   Core UDP APIs
   Function        Description
   --------------------------------
   socket()	Creates a new socket (datagram type SOCK_DGRAM) and returns a file descriptor.
   bind()   	Associates the socket with a local address and port number (optional for clients, required for servers to listen on a specific port).
   sendto()	Sends a datagram to a specific destination address and port provided as arguments.
   recvfrom()	Receives a datagram and captures the source address of the sender in a provided structure.
   close()	Releases system resources associated with the socket.
   connect()	Optional: A UDP socket can use connect() to restrict communication to a single peer, allowing use of the simpler send() and recv() functions. This creates a "connected UDP socket".

 - Arrow UP/Dwn to go through shell command history
 	   
 - Update docs with emulator instructions

 - Calander app? w/alarms - stored on mapped drive
 
 - restrict asm to only building from first to last page (256) of ROM
 - loadable apps

 - Add a file, read by the Emulator, if found, that redefines characters (E0..FE) as any unicode value
 - Add file read by the asm & emu that list nemonics to instructions
  
Done
 * Add assembler warning message if O directive is < current APA
 * Fix issue where assembler allows the inclusion of the same file more that once
 * Add bin/linux to the path for easier execution of ASM/EMU and centralized bnr script
 * Add memory mapped I/O for RTC  
 * Correct mis matched assembly instructions in docs (LBO & LTH)
 * Update docs with new HelloWorld
 * Fix bug so gmp stores full path to files
 * Fix debug line to only show the filename or limited path
 * Add length of vars to the sym file output
 * Fix step out of function so it runs until a RTL and SP >=  SP+2
 * fix tick counter so it does overflow display  
 * 'a' directive should take both digital and hex numbers currently assumes hex
 * Rand
 * Add feature where F3 zeros the tick count
 * Add flag to differentiate between const, var, and rom locations
