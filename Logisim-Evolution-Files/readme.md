## LOGISIM EVOLUTION
### Model File of the EUP5108 in [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/Emil-DV/logisim-evolution)  
This file contains all of the logic gates used for the processor as well as a desktop and "gaming" view that unfortunatly runs too slowly for complex programs  
This file was developed under my private fork of Logisim-Evolution due to some issues that have likely been fixed in the mainline of LE but I haven't tried it out yet
