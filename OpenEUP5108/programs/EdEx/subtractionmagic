Subtraction Magic

Ever wonder how a computer knows that one value is equal to another?
Or Greater Than Or Less Than?

It turns out that it is all done with subtraction
Yes subtraction is how computers make choices

Let's say you have two numbers, or things that can be numbers, age, weight, etc
if you subtract one from the other and end up with zero then the numbers must be equal
if you subtract one from the other and end up with something more than zero then
the first number was more than the second
And of course by now you figured out that if you end up with a negitive number then the first
number was less than the second
